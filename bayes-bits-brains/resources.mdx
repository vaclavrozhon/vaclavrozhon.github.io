Here are some great resources for further exploring related topics. 📚 stands for a book, 📝 for a blog posts. I tried to sort them to one of the three parts of this mini-course, but books are often relevant for several parts. 


## Part I: Bayes' rule, KL divergence, (cross-)entropy
- 📝 [Six and half intuitions for KL divergence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/no5jDTut5Byjqb4j5/six-and-a-half-intuitions-for-kl-divergence) by CallumMcDougall. 
- 📚 [Probability Theory: The Logic of Science](https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf) by E. Jaynes <Footnote>Jaynes is the father of maximum entropy principle and other profound ideas. His book is at times philosophical, and usually very enlightening. Also, it is unfinished and contains errors.</Footnote>
- 📚 [Entropic Physics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1faiZCbg_HnmKayI7hBFWfhNSuZZU451Y/view) by Ariel Caticha 
- 📚 [Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.html) by David MacKay
- 📚 [Intuition behind KL Divergence](https://johfischer.com/2021/12/31/intuitive-explanation-of-the-kullback-leibler-divergence/) by Johannes Schusterbauer. 


## Part II: Optimization
