# Abstract

🔭 This seminar explores topics in probability and algorithms.

📐 The topics are selected on the fly. Here's a general plan for this semester: We want to dig into the relations of probability with high-dimensional spaces and with some topics related to neural nets (stochastic gradient descent, adversarial attacks, ...).

📚 A basic understanding of probability is assumed (e.g. Probability 1). Fondness of probability is highly recommended. Check out notes from the past seminar (different topics, similar aesthetics) at [https://bayesbitsbrains.github.io/](https://bayesbitsbrains.github.io/).
