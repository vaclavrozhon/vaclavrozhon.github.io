# Abstract

🔭 This course explores how to effectively use artificial intelligence tools for mathematical work.

📐 We'll cover practical applications of AI in mathematical problem-solving, proof assistance, computation, and research. Topics include using AI for theorem proving, mathematical writing, computational assistance, and understanding the limitations and best practices when working with AI tools in mathematics.

📚 A basic understanding of mathematics and some familiarity with AI tools is helpful but not required.
