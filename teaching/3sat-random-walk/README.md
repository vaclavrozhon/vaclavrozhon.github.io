Jekyll-only demo
================

This directory intentionally contains a single Jekyll page `index.html` that powers the demo at `/teaching/3sat-random-walk/`.

Please do not add or maintain a separate standalone HTML copy of the demo here â€” it causes code drift and duplication. If you need to test locally without Jekyll, use `bundle exec jekyll serve` or open the built file under `_site/teaching/3sat-random-walk/index.html`.
