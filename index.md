I am an assistant professor at [Charles University, Prague](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/cs/iuuk). My [research](/research/) is in theoretical computer science. I also create algorithmic videos at [Polylog](https://www.youtube.com/@polylogcs). Here's my [resume](/assets/documents/CV.pdf). 

Before coming to Charles University, I've been a postdoc at the amazing [INSAIT](https://insait.ai/) in Sofia, advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~haeupler/">Bernhard Haeupler</a> and even before that I did my PhD at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), advised by <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/ghaffari/">Mohsen Ghaffari</a>. 

## Research

I do research in algorithms and theoretical computer science. I discuss some of it [here](/research/). 

## Polylog

I greatly enjoy creating algorithmic videos together with a great Polylog team. See [here](/polylog/) for more. 

## News

*November 2024:* Our paper about Dijkstra's algorithm has won the best paper award at FOCS 2024 and was featured by the excellent [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-establish-the-best-way-to-traverse-a-graph-20241025/) and [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/scientists-establish-the-best-algorithm-for-traversing-a-map/)!
