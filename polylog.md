I work mostly on writing scripts for the videos. There's always so much I want to say and can't, and there are always details we have to sweep under the rug. I always write about those [here](https://vasekrozhon.wordpress.com/), to be able to sleep well at night. 

I also wrote [one blog post](https://vasekrozhon.wordpress.com/2023/09/24/heuristic-arguments/) about a topic there for fun. There's a lot more I would love to write about, but I will probably not manage much until AGI.
